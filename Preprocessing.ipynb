These were     |\\n|      |  either caught in the pools, or chased into nets which we set to          |\\n|      |  intercept them. As I now took more than my share of the work, and made   |\\n|      |  all the gins, springes, and noozes which we used, a rough kind of        |\\n|      |  partnership sprung up between us. The young ducks brought us good        |\\n|      |  prices, and there was another source of income which paid well, but was  |\\n|      |  not of long duration. There is a short period in each year when even the |\\n|      |  matured wild ducks are quite unable to fly. The male of the common wild  |\\n|      |  duck is called the mallard, and soon after his brown duck begins to sit  |\\n|      |  the drake moults the whole of its flight feathers. So sudden and         |\\n|      |  simultaneous is this process that for six weeks in summer the usually    |\\n|      |  handsome drake is quite incapable of flight, and it is probably at this  |\\n|      |  period of its ground existence that the assumption of the duck\\'s plumage |\\n|      |  is such an aid to protection. Quite the handsomest of the wildfowl on    |\\n|      |  the marsh were a colony of sheldrakes which occupied a number of disused |\\n|      |  rabbit-burrows on a raised plateau overlooking the bay. The ducks were   |\\n|      |  bright chestnut, white, and purple, and in May laid from nine to a dozen |\\n|      |  creamy eggs. As these birds brought high prices for stocking ornamental  |\\n|      |  waters, we used to collect the eggs and hatch them out under hens in the |\\n|      |  turf cottage. This was a quite successful experiment up to a certain     |\\n|      |  point; but the young fowl, immediately they were hatched, seemed to be   |\\n|      |  able to smell the salt water, and would cover miles to gain the creek.   |\\n|      |  With all our combined watchfulness the downy ducklings sometimes         |\\n|      |  succeeded in reaching their loved briny element, and once in the sea     |\\n|      |  were never seen again. The pretty sea swallows used to breed on the      |\\n|      |  marsh, and the curious ruffs and reeves. These indulged in the strangest |\\n|      |  flights at breeding time, and it was then that we used to capture the    |\\n|      |  greatest numbers. We took them alive in nets, and then fattened them on  |\\n|      |  soaked wheat. The birds were sent all the way to London, and brought     |\\n|      |  good prices. By being kept closely confined and frequently fed, in a     |\\n|      |  fortnight they became so plump as to resemble balls of fat, and then     |\\n|      |  brought as much as a florin a piece. If care were not taken to kill the  |\\n|      |  birds just when they attained to their greatest degree of fatness they   |\\n|      |  fell rapidly in condition, and were nearly worthless. To kill them we    |\\n|      |  were wont to pinch off the head, and when all the blood had exuded the   |\\n|      |  flesh remained white and delicate. Greater delicacies even than ruffs    |\\n|      |  and reeves were godwits, which were fatted in like manner for the table. |\\n|      |  Experiments in fattening were upon one occasion successfully tried with  |\\n|      |  a brood of greylag geese which we discovered on the marshes. As this is  |\\n|      |  the species from which the domestic stock is descended, we found little  |\\n|      |  difficulty in herding, though we were always careful to house them at    |\\n|      |  night, and pinioned them as the time of the autumnal migration came      |\\n|      |  round. We well knew that the skeins of wild geese which at this time     |\\n|      |  nightly cross the sky, calling as they fly, would soon have robbed us of |\\n|      |  our little flock.                                                        |'"
